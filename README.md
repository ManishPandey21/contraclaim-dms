Contractual Correspondence DMS Web Application Development
Project Overview
The Contract Department requires a Document Management System (DMS) to efficiently handle contractual correspondence. The system should enable users to track, organize, retrieve, and collaborate on contract-related documents such as letters, claims, approvals, and other official communications.

Key Objectives
Organized Storage: Store all contractual letters with structured metadata.
Easy Search & Retrieval: Search letters using various criteria (tags, references, subjects, etc.).
Tagging & Reference Linking: Link correspondence based on contractual matters (e.g., Hindrance, EOT, Variation, Claim, DWP).
Collaboration & Drafting: Provide tools for drafting replies and tracking communication history.
Version Control & Approvals: Maintain a review and approval workflow.
Secure Access Management: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different users.
